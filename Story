On a fine morning, a tortoise and a rabbit were talking.
 After sometime the rabbit boasted about his skill to run very fast and taunted the tortoise on his slow speed. 
 Hearing this, the tortoise decided to have a competition with the rabbit. 
 The rabbit laughed but agreed anyhow.
 The very next day, the competition was held. 
 First one to reach the tree far away would be deemed as the winner.
 The race began and as expected the rabbit shot off, leaving the tortoise far behind.
 A few minutes later, the rabbit had almost reached the finish line and the tortoise was nowhere in sight.
